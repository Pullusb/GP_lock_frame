## Description

![lock frame](https://github.com/Pullusb/images_repo/raw/master/PAPERMOD_Lock_frame.png)

Lock you in space and/or time to focus on your 2D still painting.  
Actually it's not specific to Grease pencil, but it was made with single static drawing in mind.
  
You can accidentally moved in time and it created a new frame.  
*Time lock* the current frame and disable playback

Also in some session you can trigger accidentally the viewport rotation then have to remacth the view,  
*lock view* switch to pan-only mode (the shortcut to rotate becomes also a pan)
